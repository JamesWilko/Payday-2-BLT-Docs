# PaydayMods Mod Manager
The online Mod Manager is what allows for all mods using the Payday 2 BLT to take advantage of the automatic updates system.
This is what is used to publish new versions of your mod to your users without them having to manually download and install a new version.

As stated on the [Automatic Updates](updates.md) page, you will need an account to be able to access the Mod Manager, and create and upload mods.
[Contact one of us](http://paydaymods.com/contact/) if you want to get an account setup, and we'll set you up.
